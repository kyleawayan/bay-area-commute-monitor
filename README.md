# Bay Area Commute Monitor

Built with [v0](https://v0.dev). Currently tested with Muni Metro Light Rail, but it can ingest data from other transit operators (e.g., CalTrain, BART) via the [511 API](https://511.org/open-data). Support for all operators has not been fully tested yet.

Data updates in real-time.
